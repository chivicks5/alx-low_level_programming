Libraries in C are collections of pre-written code that can be reused in other programs.
These libraries contain functions, data types, and other resources that can help simplify programming tasks.
Here are some of the main libraries in C:

Standard C Library (libc):
This is the most common library in C and contains many basic functions for tasks like input/output,
string manipulation, memory management, and math operations.

C Standard Template Library (STL): This library provides data structures and algorithms that can help simplify complex programming tasks.

Math Library (libm): This library contains mathematical functions like trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponential functions.

Graphics Libraries: There are several libraries available for creating graphics in C, such as OpenGL and SDL.

Networking Libraries: Libraries like Berkeley Sockets and WinSock provide tools for programming network applications in C.

POSIX Library: This library provides a standard interface for interacting with the operating system,
including file operations, process management, and inter-process communication.

Overall, libraries in C are an important tool for simplifying programming tasks and improving code reusability.
