A pointer is a variable pointing to the address of another variable. It is declared along with an asterisk symbol (*). The syntax to declare a pointer is as follows:
datatype *var1
The syntax to assign the address of a variable to a pointer is:
datatype var1, *var2;
var2=&var1;

String in C programming is a sequence of characters terminated with a null character ‘\0’. 
Strings are defined as an array of characters.
