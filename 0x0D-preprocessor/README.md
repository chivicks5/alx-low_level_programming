The C preprocessor is a program that is run by the compiler
before the actual compilation process starts. Here are five key points to help explain what the C preprocessor does:

The C preprocessor processes source code files and performs macro expansions,
which replace defined symbols with their corresponding values.

The preprocessor can also include files using the #include directive,
which copies the contents of another file into the current file.

The preprocessor can conditionally include or exclude code based on expressions
using the #if, #ifdef, and #ifndef directives.

The preprocessor can define or undefine symbols using the #define and #undef directives.
The preprocessor generates preprocessed output code that is then passed to the compiler
for actual compilation. This preprocessed code includes all the expansions and modifications made by the preprocessor.
