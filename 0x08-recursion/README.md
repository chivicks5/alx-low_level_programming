Recursion is a concept in computer science 
and programming where a function calls itself during its execution. 
This can be a bit confusing at first, but it can be a powerful tool for solving problems.

Let's imagine that you are asked to count the 
number of nested boxes in a larger box. 
Each box may contain smaller boxes, which may contain even smaller boxes, and so on. 
To solve this problem, you could use a recursive function.
